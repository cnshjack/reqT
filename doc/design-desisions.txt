* Entity leaf nodes
  To simplify the inheritance hierarchy, Entity is not a Key. 
  Instead, single entities are represented as a has-relation with empty tail.
  Req("x").has() is thus a proxy for Req("x")

* Relations are case objects with non-capitalized names.
  This causes problems in matches and requires backticks, 
  but was chosen as it is more intuitive to write 
    Req("x") has Spec("abc") 
  compared to 
    Req("x") Has Spec("abc")
